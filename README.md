# Internal Inventory - Tappau Comics
This project will manage a internal web app for a comic book business, in which comic books are allocated a box, in order to reduce searching for a comic upon request.

QR codes are utilised to discover what comics are contained within a box, and search functionality wil be provided to discover what box a given item is located in.
